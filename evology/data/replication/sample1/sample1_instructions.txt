Hey,

this is a 10 year sample run. The wealth concentrations are 0.42, 0.33, 0.25, close to the equilibrium point.

Other settings are:

Noise trader
aggression = 5.0
lambda bar = 1.0
Value Investor
aggression = 6.0
lambda bar = 4.0
Trend follower
aggression = 1.5
lambda bar = 0.666

For the first 21 days, the wealth gets reset to burn in the system (otherwise there can be dramatic wealth shifts during initialisation). Afterwards the wealth is free to evolve. Usually for these settings, the system runs for 100 years or more before one of the strategies goes bankrupt, so for a three player market that is rather stable.

0_dividend.txt is the daily dividend payment
prices.txt are realised market prices
volumes.txt is the net transacted amount

Then for every fund (2: noise trader, 3: value investor, 4: trend follower) the following items are traced:
cash value
market value of securities
loans
securities lending (value of short positions)
profits and losses (pnl)
net asset value
part of the investment signal, e.g. fundamental value for the NT and value investor, and the momentum factor for the trend follower
