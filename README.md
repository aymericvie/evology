# Known issues

- Price (& wealth) either goes to 0 or to infinity. Very unstable.
- Fixed supply of assets does not seem enforced


# Todo-ongoing

- [WFF] Short selling needs to be handled in some way (loans, margin)
- LEAP_EC 0.6 update should be live soon https://pypi.org/project/leap-ec/

# To watch
- non negative cash for asset purchases is now implemented, but say vigilant 
- list_ed_func looks fixed now

# Notes


# Current testing state

- Dividend, interest rate, wealth updates behave as expected (02.06.21)
- Trading signal, excess demand work well (02.06.21)
- For positive ED, reassignment to assets works well (02.06.21)


## Forthcoming

- Market clearing 2.0 (ESL)
- Redo plots for analysis from df
